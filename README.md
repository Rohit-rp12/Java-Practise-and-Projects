## üìñ About

This repository is perfect for beginners and intermediate programmers looking to improve their Java skills. It covers a broad range of topics, from basic syntax and operations to more complex concepts like Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), GUI development, and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The exercises and projects included are designed to build your confidence and competence in Java programming.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by "days," with each day focusing on specific topics and concepts. Below is an overview of the structure:

### **Day 1: Basics**
- **6 Codes**: Introduction to basic data types, summation of two numbers, area and perimeter of a rectangle, and swapping two variables (with and without a third variable).

### **Day 2: Operators**
- **1 Code**: Comprehensive code covering all operators. Example: Take a sum amount from the user and return the number of denominations of notes needed to cover that amount.

### **Day 3: If-Else Conditional Statements**
- **6 Codes**: Maximum of two numbers, maximum of three numbers (two approaches), odd-even checker, and other basic concepts.

### **Day 4: Call by Value/Pass by Value**
- **1 Code**: Demonstration of call by value concept in Java.

### **Day 5: Functions**
- **4 Codes**: Summation of two numbers through four different types of user-defined functions.

### **Day 6: Function Examples**
- **3 Codes**: Multiplication of two numbers, calculation of factorial, and Binomial Coefficient (nCr formula).

### **Day 7: Function Overloading**
- **1 Code**: Function overloading using different parameters and data types.

### **Day 8-9: While Loop**
- **10 Codes**: Check prime numbers, find prime factors, Armstrong number, factorial, palindrome, find max and min digits, count digits, sum of digits, sum of 'n' numbers, and sum of digits in a number.

### **Day 10: For Loop**
- **9 Codes**: Different types of series problems using the for loop.

### **Day 11: Switch-Case**
